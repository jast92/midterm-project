# midterm-project

This project is a contribution to the "Data Analytics" Bootcamp of Ironhack Berlin in 2020. If you are interested in other Data Science projects which I have worked on, feel free to browse my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jast92/).

#### Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to show understanding of the main concepts of analysing raw data and building prediction models in a supervised learning manner. I used Tableau and various packages in Python to create data visualizations. I used furthermore SQL and Python for exploratory data analysis. When building prediction models I made use of Python and various packages to set up different models utilizing linear regression, KNN and Decision Tree.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Tableau
* MySql
* Python
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Numpy
  * Seaborn
  * Statsmodels
  * Sklearn
* Jupyter

## Information over dataset
The dataset consists of information of about 22,000 property sales in King County (Washington, USA). The dataset consists of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015.

### These are the definitions of data points provided:

Note: For some of the variables are self-explanatory, no definition has been provided.

* id: Unique identification number for the property
* date: the date the house was sold
* price: the price of the house
* waterfront: the house which has a view to a waterfront
* condition: How good the condition is (Overall). 1 indicates worn-out property and 5 excellent.
* grade: Overall grade given to the housing unit, based on the King County grading system. 1 poor, 13 excellent.
* sqft_above: square footage of house apart from the basement
* sqft_living15: Living room area in 2015(implies-- some renovations) This might or might not have affected the lotSize area.
* sqft_lot15: lotSize area in 2015(implies-- some renovations)

## Needs of this project

- Data exploration/descriptive statistics
- Data processing/cleaning
- Statistical modeling
- Writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. For a first overview of the data, you can find a visual analysis of the data on my [Tableau profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/janek.stein#!/).
2. The original (raw) data can be found [here](https://github.com/jast92/midterm-project/tree/main/data).
3. MySQL scripts to set up new database with original data and queries for creating more insights out of the raw data can be found [here](https://github.com/jast92/midterm-project/tree/main/sql-queries).
4. The Jupyter Notebook with all the data processing/cleaning steps as well as all iterations of applying different models to make predictions can be found (ending "iterations") as well as a cleaner final version with the most significant models (ending "final") [here](https://github.com/jast92/midterm-project/tree/main/jupyter-notebooks).


## Optimization of models
When you feel intrigued by my analysis and you want to collaborate to make the models even better, feel free to reach out to me (contact information see below)!
